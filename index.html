<p>Sexpbot is a small project I'm working on. It's an IRC bot that does all sorts of cool shit. You can find it in #clojure-casual and #() on irc.freenode.net. It totally functional right now, but getting it working on your own box might be hard right now. I'll be making it easier to run the bot as your own and such soon.</p>
<p>Here is a list of commands. Might be incomplete or outdated:</p>
<p>Default prepend is $</p>
<ul>
<li>google takes a phrase and then googles for it.</li>
<li>lmgtfy takes a phrase, and optionally a user's nick after a @ sign at the end and gives you a lmgtfy URL, optionally directed to the nick after the @.</li>
<li>time gives you the current time and date in UTC format.</li>
<li>rape rapes the nick supplied.</li>
<li>what throws away it's arguments and prints out "It's AWWWWWW right!".</li>
<li>pangram? checks to see if it's input is a pangram.</li>
<li>join takes a channel and joins it.</li>
<li>part takes a channel and leaves it.</li>
<li>coin tosses a coin.</li>
<li>help prints out a help message.</li>
<li>fuck throws away it's arguments and prints out "no u".</li>
<li>setnick takes a nick and changes to it.</li>
<li>exists? checks to see if the supplied directory or file exists on the system the bot is running on. Invasion of privaceh!</li>
<li>learn assigns it's first argument to a string of the last arguments and stores them in a Clojure map in a .clj file.</li>
<li>whatis recalls it's first argument from the map.</li>
<li>forget deletes the entry from the map.</li>
<li>quit forces the bot to quit.</li>
<li>loaded? prints a list of loaded messages.</li>
<li>unload unloads a module.</li>
<li>load loads a module.</li>
<li>eval or $( executes the clojure code following. Paren is inclusive.</li>
<li>8ball is a normal magic eightball.</li>
<li>botsnack gives the bot a tasty bot treat!</li>
<li>dytostr converts a string of Dynamic to plaintext.</li>
<li>dict looks a word up in the wordnik database.</li>
<li>bf executes a string of brainfuck</li>
<li>dumpwdb dumps the entire whatis database to gist.github.com</li>
<li>fcst takes a location, i.e. zip code, city,state, and gets that location's forecast from wunderground.</li>
<li>scheck takes a word and tries to correct it's spelling</li>
